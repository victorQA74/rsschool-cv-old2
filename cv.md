### About me

I work in technical support at an IT company. Support at the second line level, common software used in the bank. My goal is to move to a level above technical support. I like to learn new things.

### Skills

I graduated from internal QA courses, gained basic knowledge of the java programming language and the basics of test automation.

### Code example 

#### smoke test

```package smoke;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class Test2 {

    @Test (groups = {"smokeTest", "regress"})
    public void test21() {
        System.out.println("Test 21");
    }
    @Test
    public void test22() {
        System.out.println("Test 22");
    }
    @Test (groups = {"regress"})
    public void test23() {
        System.out.println("Test 23");
    }
    @Test
    public void test24() {
        System.out.println("Test 24");
    }
}
```
